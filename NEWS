## GPareto 1.0.2

## change / GPareto 1.0.1
  * new function 'easyGParetoptim', a user-friendly wrapper of the function 'GParetoptim' with arguments as the base optim method
  * change arguments 'fun' and 'cheapfun' of 'GParetoptim' and 'crit_optimizer' to 'fn' and 'cheapfn' to match arguments of 'optim' and 'easyGParetoptim'
  * new function 'getDesign', to get the best design corresponding to a given target
  * new function 'plotGPareto' to display the result of an optimization, possibly quantifiying the uncertainty on it
  * a random point is selected with GParetoptim is the inner optimization of the criterion failed by returning an already known point
  * no more messages about refPoints when trace is 0
  * bug corrected in crit_SMS with eps
  * bug corrected with seed for genoud and for EHI, EMI
  * bug corrected for SUR
  * correct bug in automatic refPoint selection
  * passing any optimizer to crit_optimizer is now possible
  * add method simulate to class 'fastfun'
  * penalty with checkPredict to -1 for all criterion
  * nb.samp reduced to 50 for SAA approximation of EHI and EMI for faster evaluation
  * printing of iterations with 'GParetoptim' improved
  * correct bug with 'GParetoptim' when no 'optimcontrol' does not contain a method
  * shorter argument 'n.grid' instead of 'nPointsGrid' in 'plotParetoGrid'
  * modifications of display with GParetoptim when no refPoint is provided
  * corrections and modifications in the documentation of 'GParetoptim', 'crit_SMS', 'plotParetoEmp' and 'CPF'
  * modifications to 'checkPredict' to take into account arbitrary position of 'fastfun' functions 
  * the example of 'crit_SUR' is now the same as the other criteria
  * correct bugs with d>2 with test functions ZDT1-6
  * correct bug in MOP2
  * correct bug with 'crit_EHI' when PF is provided but not refPoint


## change / GPareto 1.0.0

  * update of references
  * bug corrected in 'plotParetoEmp' to account for the case with a single point
  * possibility in 'plotParetoEmp' to display a Pareto front with maximization
  * bug corrected in 'crit_EHI' to count the number of objectives
